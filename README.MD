- Prop-to-Hunter attack (Prop Revenge)
- Integrated Prop Menu (Prop Chooser)
- Tweaks and Optimisation
- Team Balance and Team Switch Control
- And many other implementations that currently still on progress...

### Change Logs
To see what things are changed, see: https://wolvindra.xyz/prophuntx?showlog=1

However, there are several changes with codes structure which was cleaned-up, new HUD & user interface,
mechanics and optimisation that should be (or already) included in future updates. This is may also a part of a continuation version 15 (rev. I) 
which will be a finalized version and continue with revision changes.

### The "X"
Prop Hunt "X" is a temporal codename. We still not sure what should be named.

However, this isn't a continuation or resurrected version of PH:E Post-v16 development lineup,  
this is another standalone version made from Wolvin himself, using a fork from PH:E v15-Rev I which was intended for Project purposes.
